# PLANEA

Analysis pipeline for the 2019 - PLANEA test. This test is part of the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) and is an effort to evaluate the education level in the country.

If the DAG is not running it could be because of it's failed logs so you should probably run a `clear`.

For example:

```{bash}
airdb clear ingest
```
